# Arch Linux Setup Script

This repository contains a post-installation script (`install-apps.sh`) to quickly set up a full-featured desktop environment on Arch Linux or any Arch-based distribution (e.g. CachyOS, EndeavourOS, Garuda, etc.).

It installs a collection of essential developer tools, creative apps, browsers, system utilities, media tools, and virtualization clients.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nick4vh/arch-packages.git

2. Navigate into the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd arch-packages

3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install-apps.sh

4. Run the script:
    ```bash
    ./install-apps.sh

Alternatively, run it directly without cloning:
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nick4vh/arch-packages/main/install-apps.sh)
